    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players,team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Adam';
    console.log(players,team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players[4] = 'Sam';
    console.log(players,team);
    // now here is the problem!
    team[5] = 'Greenie';
    console.log(players);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    group = players.slice();

    console.log('This is group:',group);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    gang = [].concat(group);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    squad = [...gang];
    console.log(squad);
    squad[6] = "Joker";
    console.log(squad);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Warren Wells',
      age: 42
    };
    console.log(person)
    const capitan = Object.assign({},person,{number: 8, age: 24});
    console.log(capitan)
    const guy = {...person};
    console.log(guy);
    person.old = 'true';
    console.log(person,guy);
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: "Kyla",
